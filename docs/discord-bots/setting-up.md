# Setting-up User

The following bots will be installed in a separate user space.

    sudo adduser --disabled-login discord

## Requirements

When hosting your own bots for Discord you'll need a bot token, which is generated when creating an application account on Discord. I won't get into further detail, but I'll leave a guide that I made previously for a bot that I made:

* [Getting a bot token.](https://github.com/moonstar-x/discord-downtime-notifier/wiki/Getting-a-Discord-Bot-Token)
* [Finding out your user ID.](https://github.com/moonstar-x/discord-downtime-notifier/wiki/Getting-User,-Channel-and-Server-IDs)
* [Adding your bot to your server.](https://github.com/moonstar-x/discord-downtime-notifier/wiki/Adding-Your-Bot-To-Your-Server)

The following guides are not limited to music bots, you can follow these guides for any kind of bot.
